This repository provides code for applying machine learning algorithms to bike sharing data, including both regression and classification tasks. Regression models include Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression, while classification models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.

# Bike Sharing Data Analysis with Machine Learning

## Models Implemented:

### Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression

### Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The project demonstrates how to apply basic machine learning techniques for both predicting continuous outcomes (regression) and classifying categorical outcomes (classification).
